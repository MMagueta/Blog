* About me

If you were to ask me who I am, I would not deny the trouble it would
be. I am a software engineer, but such description is not
meaningful. What kind of a software engineer am I? Since when I
learned about the works in theology, philosophy, grammar and
computation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramon_Llull][Ramon Llull]] I wondered if programming is not just about
philosophy. It's the process of mapping one's thought into actuality,
simply put, identifying universals via the rational thought on a
relentless attempt to formalize them in a grammar (read as programming
language).

Given that motto that has been ruling my life ever since, I pursue
what I can assess to be the best tools out there in order to approach
truth and the real. F# is my main language, for I believe that by it
having a strict and solid grammar, and being based on core aspects of
the theory of computation, the path to truth is clearer. On the same
realm of interest, I hold dearly philosophy, functional programming,
literature, history, algebra, theology, type theory and et cetera. With such
interests as measure, suddenly all my tools makes sense: freedom and
truth come to justify Emacs, *nix, NixOS, F#, types and all my
tools over the belt.

In short, I fell in love with truth and I cannot see myself not
seeking it.
