#+TITLE: Magueta's Personal Blog

* About

In this repository you have access to the source code of my blog. The
entire web site is made generated using GNU/Emacs, where the posts are
written in org-mode and scripting is made with Elisp, no Javascript.

For more information on how to use such source code, I made a post
about it at https://www.marcosmagueta.com/essays/programming/hosting-emacs-nix.html
